    <p>This Tamil romance novel is just one of many that can be found in my childhood home, specifically located in my appamma's room. Whenever I walk past her door, I catch glimpses of her engaged in various activities to keep herself occupied: reading, praying, napping, and even crafting. However, it's the books that have always intrigued me. Where does she acquire them? Who designs the stunningly illustrated covers? And, perhaps most importantly, are they a popular read? 
    <br>
    <br>
      As I ponder over these questions, I find myself contemplating my appamma's relationship with these novels. Does she, like me, long to be transported into the world of the characters? Does she visualize the scenarios with the same level of vivid detail? Could she have harbored aspirations to become a writer herself? It's these very mysteries that reveal how little I truly know about my own appamma. 
    <br>  
    <br>
      The origins of these books are shrouded in mystery, and I remain clueless as to how they made their way into our home. Nevertheless, they have prompted me to explore the complexities of my appamma's character and have inspired me to connect with her on a deeper level.  </p>
