      <p>The Laughing Buddha statue is considered a symbol of good fortune, prosperity, and success in many cultures, and it is often placed in homes to attract these blessings. Despite being from a Hindu family, we also embraced this belief and prominently displayed the statue at the main entrance of our home. I still remember the day when my appa brought the statue home and took the time to explain its significance to us. He stressed how it would bring positive energy and help us prosper and succeed in life. I was just five years old at the time, but I took my appa's words seriously, and I eagerly anticipated waking up to a mansion-like home filled with wealth and prosperity. Unfortunately, the following day, everything seemed unchanged, and my youthful expectations were quickly deflated. Nevertheless, I learned that success and prosperity are not magically bestowed but require hard work, perseverance, and dedication.</p>
