      <p>Both of my parents come from Jaffna, or as it is also known, Yazhpanam. Specifically, they come from the charming villages, or "ooru," of Erlalai and Urumpirai. These villages were once tightly knit communities where everyone knew each other, embodying the idyllic rural lifestyle that one might imagine. However, due to the war, numerous Tamil families were forced to flee Eelam, the northern and northeastern region of Sri Lanka where a significant proportion of the Tamil population resided. This displacement caused them to abandon their beloved hometowns and seek refuge in Canada, hoping to rediscover the sense of community they had before the war.

        In order to stay connected with their fellow villagers and preserve that sense of community, Tamil people began forming clubs with other residents from their respective villages who had also settled in Canada. These clubs organized various events, trips, and sports meets, which typically took place during the summer. During these sports meets, all the children would participate in friendly competitions against one another. This particular trophy was awarded during the 2013 sports meet held by my dad's village. While I am unsure of who exactly won the trophy, let it serve as a testament to the competitive spirit that my sister and I displayed during these friendly competitions. </p>
